The reason that C is not technically , a block-structured language is that block-structured languages permit procedures or functions.
However, since C does not allow the creation of functions within functions, it cannot formally be called block-structured.

STRUCTURED AND NON-STRUCTURED LANGUAGE EXAMPLE

Name of some of the Non-structured language are :-
1) BASIC
2) FORTRAN
3) COBOL

Name of some of the Structured language are :-
1) Pascal
2) Ada
3) C++
4) C
5) Java
6) Modula-2

Structured language tends to be of more recent creation. In fact, a mark of an old computer language is that it is non-structured.
Today, few programmers would consider using a non-structured language for serious, new programs.

Note -- New versions of many older languages have attempted to add structured elements.BASIC is an example. However, the shortcomings 
of these languages can never be fully mitigated because they were not designed along structured design principles from beginning.
