It is important to understand that a computer language defines the nature of a program and not the way that the program will be executed. There are two general methods by which a program can be executed. It can be compiled , or it can be interpreted. Although programs written in any computer language can be compiled or interpreted , some languages are designed more for one form of execution than the other. For example, Java was designred to be interpreted, and C was designed to be compiled. However, in the case of C, it is important to know that it was specifically optimezed as a conmpiled language. Although C interpreters have been written and are available in some environments (especially as a debugging aids or as experimental platforms), C was developed with compilation in mind. Therefore , it is very common to see more C compilers than the C interpreters while developing our C programs.
   What is the difference between a Compiler and an Interpreter?? 
   Ans :- Interpreter: In a simple form interpreter reads the source code of a program one line at a time, performing the specific instructions contained in that line. This is the way earlier versions of BASIC worked . In languages line Java , a program's code is first converted into an intermidiary form that is then interpreted. In either case, a run-time interpreter is still required to be [resent to excecute the program.
          Compiler  : A compiler reads the entire program and converts it into object code, which is a translation of the program's source code into a form that the computer can execute directly. Object code is also referred to as binary code or machine code. Once the program is compiled , a line of souorce code is no longer meaningful in the execution of your program.

In short a compiler is more suitable and is used more as comapared to the interpreter in this modern computing world.
C is a language made keeping compilation in mind.
